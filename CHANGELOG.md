* Derive implementations of `liftTyped` (in addition to `lift`) when using
  `template-haskell-2.16` or later.
* Fix a bug in which derived `Lift` instances for data types containing
  `Addr#` would fail to typecheck.

## [0.8.0.1] - 2019-05-09

* Support GHC 8.8/`template-haskell-2.15`.

## [0.8] - 2019-04-26

* Remove `Lift ()`, `Ratio`, `Identity` and `Const ()` instances.
  These are now provided in [`th-lift-instances` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift-instances)
- Use `TemplateHaskellQuotes` where available

## [0.7.11] - 2018-08-27

## [0.7.5] - 2015-11-19

  instance manually. (Thanks to Ryan Scott).
* Support empty datatypes and unboxed types.

## [0.7] - 2014-12-07

* Support GHC 7.9 and hopefully 7.10, thanks to Richard Eisenberg.
* On versions of GHC that support role inference, don't constrain
  phantom type variables.
* Get rid of some orphan instances when using GHC >= 7.9.

## [0.6] - 2013-12-09

* Support GHC 7.8, thanks to Michael Snoyberg.
* Support existentially quantified type variables in datatype
  declarations.

* Support older GHCs and Cabal, thanks to Ben Millwood.

## [0.5] - 2010-08-05

* Support for contexts in datatypes, thanks to Ben Millwood.
* `deriveLiftWith` becomes `deriveLift'` and takes an `Info`
  structure rather than a custom reification function.
* Add `deriveLiftMany` to derive many `Lift` instances in one go.

## [0.4] - 2010-08-02

* Add support for newtypes and records syntax, thanks to a patch by
  Ben Millwood.
* Add support for infix constructors.
* `deriveLift` returns a list of declarations.
